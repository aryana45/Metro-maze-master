METRO MAZE MASTER is a project designed to showcase the application of graph theory and algorithms in a real-world scenario. This project simulates the Delhi Metro system, providing users with features to find the shortest, fastest, and most economical routes between stations. It also includes an admin section for managing and adding new stations to the system.



## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Calculate the shortest, fastest, and most economical routes between any two stations using advanced graph algorithms.
- **Dynamic Station Management**: Admin interface to add, update, or remove metro stations.
- **Real-time Updates**: Reflects changes in station data and routes in real-time.
